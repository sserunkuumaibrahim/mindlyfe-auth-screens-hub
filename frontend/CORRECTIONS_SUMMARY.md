# MindLyfe Frontend Corrections Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the corrections made to align the frontend documentation with the actual MindLyfe system architecture based on examination of the real backend implementation and service communication patterns.

## ðŸ”§ Major Corrections Made

### 1. LyfBot Service Architecture âœ…

**Previous Issue**: LyfBot was incorrectly described as integrated within chat service
**Correction Applied**:
- **LyfBot is a Standalone Service** (Port 8003): Separate FastAPI service for AI conversations
- **Accessed via API Gateway**: Routes through `/lyfbot/*` endpoints, not chat
- **Service Integration**: LyfBot communicates with AI Service (8000), Journal Service (8001), and Recommender Service (8002)
- **Conversation Management**: Own database (`mindlyf_lyfbot`) with conversation history and context
- **Crisis Detection**: Built-in crisis detection with emergency response protocols
- **Context Awareness**: Uses journal insights and user data for personalized responses

### 2. Chat vs Community vs LyfBot Separation âœ…

**Previous Issue**: Services were incorrectly merged or misunderstood
**Correction Applied**:
- **Chat Service** (Port 3003): Real-time messaging between users, therapists, and groups
  - Room types: direct, group, support, therapy
  - Socket.IO for real-time communication
  - Integration with Community Service for mutual follow verification
  - Integration with Teletherapy Service for therapist-client relationships

- **Community Service** (Port 3004): Anonymous social platform
  - Anonymous posting with generated pseudonyms
  - Follow system enabling chat access through mutual follows
  - Content moderation and privacy controls

- **LyfBot Service** (Port 8003): AI-powered mental health assistant
  - Standalone conversational AI interface
  - Context-aware responses using user data
  - Crisis detection and emergency response
  - Integration with multiple AI microservices

### 3. Accurate Service Communication Patterns âœ…

**Previous Issue**: Service interactions were assumed rather than documented
**Correction Applied**:
- **LyfBot â†’ AI Service**: Generates conversational responses using OpenAI
- **LyfBot â†’ Journal Service**: Gets user insights for context-aware responses
- **LyfBot â†’ Recommender Service**: Retrieves personalized activity suggestions
- **Chat Service â†’ Community Service**: Verifies mutual follow relationships for chat access
- **Chat Service â†’ Teletherapy Service**: Verifies therapist-client relationships
- **All Services â†’ Auth Service**: JWT token validation and service authentication

### 4. Real API Endpoints and Data Models âœ…

**Previous Issue**: API endpoints were invented without backend verification
**Correction Applied**:
- **LyfBot Service Endpoints**: 
  - `POST /api/v1/conversations` - Create conversations
  - `POST /api/v1/messages` - Send messages with streaming responses
  - `GET /api/v1/context` - Get user context for personalized responses
  - `POST /api/v1/feedback` - Submit conversation feedback

- **Chat Service Endpoints**: 
  - `POST /chat/rooms` - Create chat rooms
  - `GET /chat/rooms` - Get user's chat rooms
  - `POST /chat/messages` - Send messages in rooms

- **Community Service Endpoints**:
  - `GET /api/posts` - Get community posts
  - `POST /api/follows` - Follow/unfollow users
  - `GET /api/follow/follows/:userId/:targetId` - Verify relationships
